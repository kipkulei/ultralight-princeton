                            <p>Bio-based phase change material (PCM), which changes phase (e.g. melting or freezing) to absorb or release relatively large amounts of latent heat at a constant temperature. When the temperature becomes warmer than the freeze point of the PCM it will liquefy, absorbing and storing heat during the process. Conversely, when the temperature drops, the material will solidify and give off heat, warming the material coated or impregnated with PCM. This material has the capability to keep the temperature constant for an extended period of time. It is mostly applied in casting.</p>

                            <p>3D textile composed of top and bottom lattices of carbon fiber, polyester (PET) or polypropylene (PP) binding yarns, and a “pilewarp” of polyethylene (PE) monofilament to create the spacial structure. The advantage of carbon over other materials for concrete reinforcement, including conventional steel or glass fiber, is its superior resistance to alkalis and corrosion; this material makes it unnecessary to have a thick exterior concrete covering in order to protect the reinforcement from corrosion. It is mostly applied in casting.</p>

                            <p>A breathable, dimensionally stable, polyurethane-based gel that is shock absorbent and distributes pressure equally. The gel is flexible and elastic with good recovery properties. It does not contain plasticizers or other volatile components so it is stable and retains its properties over an extended time. It can be stamped or cut into shaped sheets, individually molded into shapes, directly laminated with decorative materials during manufacture, or bonded later with standard polyurethane glue.

                            <p>An engineered thermoplastic honeycomb comprised of a co-extruded polycarbonate (PC) for energy absorption. This structure provides uniform mechanical properties due to its circular cell structure, and offers high compressive strength in a low-density material, decreasing transmitted force and peak g-force acceleration. The honeycomb is an efficient energy absorber, which is vital to impact protection, and is highly breathable. Some of its applications are in: Die Cutting, Lamination, Metal Working Tools, Thermoforming/Compression Molding, and WoodWorking Tools</p>
