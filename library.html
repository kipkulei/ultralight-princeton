    <h1>A library of my favorite Kenyan recipes</h1>
    <br> 
    <p>Welcome to my library of Kenyan recipes. Being an international student from Kenya, 
        I find myself missing a lot of these dishes as I am not a great cook myself. Therefore, 
        I thought I would share some recipes and pictures on this page in the hopes that I'll be 
        motivated to try and master them. Enjoy!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Snacks/ Pastries</h2>
    <h3>Bhajia</h3>
    <img src="images/bhajia.jpeg" alt="A photo of Bhajia" width="400"><br><br>
    <p>This snack is usually made of thin potato slices, coated in a spicy gram flour and deep-fried. 
        It was a popular street food that I indulged in every day from school when I was younger. 
        Brings back memories each time I have it.</p>

        <summary><strong>Recipe</strong></summary>
        <h5>Ingredients for the Potato Bhajia</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 medium sized potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup of Gram Flour</li>
            <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Fresh/powdered ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of turmeric</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of coriander</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Chilli powder</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped coriander</li>
            <li>1 cup of water</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Ingredients for the dipping sauce</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of fresh/powder ginger</li>
            <li>3-5 fresh chillies</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>Peel the potatoes and clean them thoroughly.<br>
            Slice then into thin round slices.
            Not as thin as potato crisps, but not as thick as chips(fries)<br>
            Let them soak in clean water for about 5 minutes to help get rid of any extra starch.<br>
            Rinse thoroughly about 3 times, until the water runs clear.<br>
            Drain the water and dry them completely using either kitchen or paper towels.
            This step of drying is important because it ensures that the Bhajia batter is not watered down as you coat the potatoes.<br>
            Mix all the ingredients of the batter and add the water slowly until you get an even thick consistency.<br>
            Aim for a consistency that is slightly thinner than pancake batter.<br>
            Dip the dry potato slices into the batter and ensure they are all well coated.<br>
            Heat some oil on medium heat until ready to deep-fry.<br>
            Drop the potato slices into the oil one-by-one.<br>
            Ensure you do not overcrowd the pan because this will bring down the temperature of the oil.
            Deep fry for 8-10 minutes until they are golden brown.<br>
            Remove and place on paper towels to drain the excess oil and repeat until all the potatoes are cooked.<br>
            Add all the ingredients into a blender and add 1 cup of water.
            Blend until everything mixed together.<br>
            The consistency does not have to be perfectly smooth.<br>
            Alternatively, use a grater for all the ingredients in case you don’t have a blender.<br>
            Add the blended mixture into a saucer pan and simmer over low heat for 10 minutes until it thickens and becomes darker in colour.<br>
            Remove and serve alongside the hot potato bhajias.

    <h3>Maandazi</h3>
    <img src="images/maandazi.jpeg" alt="A photo of Maandazi" width="400"><br><br>
    <p>This is a pastry that I enjoyed with tea as breakfast for a huge part of my life. 
        Tastes a lot like a doghnut, looks a lot like beignet but denser.</p>

    <h3>Chapati</h3>
    <img src="images/chapati.jpeg" alt="A photo of Chapati" width="400"><br><br>
    <p>This is a soft, flaky, chewy flatbread that is a staple part of celebratory meals in Kenya and other East African Countries. 
    I usually enjoy it with curries and different stews as a main meal, and with tea or eggs for breakfast as well.</p>

    <img src="images/ugali_choma.jpeg" alt="A photo of a plate of Ugali and Nyama Choma" width="400"><br><br>
    <p>This is probably one of my best dishes of all time. 
        The Ugali is a form of cornmeal dough made from mostly maize flour and served with grilled goat meat and greens.</p>
    <details>
        <summary><strong>Recipe</strong></summary>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white finely ground cornmeal</li>
            <li>2 pounds goat meat (ribs or steak)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized ginger</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
            <li>4 fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <p>
            <strong>Marinate the goat meat</strong><br><br>
            Make small incisions on the meat and place it in a large bowl.<br>
            Grind the garlic and ginger, place in the bowl, and add squeezed lemon juice and black pepper. <br>
            Toss the meat with the spices, making sure it’s well spread on the meat.<br>
            Cover the bowl and leave to marinate for 2 hours (you can refrigerate if you like).<br>
            <strong>Grill the meat</strong> <br><br>
            Light a grill and let the coal get hot before placing the meat over the fire.<br>
            Once the grill is hot enough, place the meat on the grate.<br>
            Add salt and cooking oil to the cup of water.<br>
            Turn the meat periodically to cook on both sides while basting it with the salt water.<br>
            Once the meat turns golden brown, slice it to see if it’s cooked inside. <br> 
            Wrap it in foil when it’s done and place it on low heat or the warming rack while you prepare to serve.<br>
            <strong>Cook the ugali</strong><br><br>
            Bring the water to a boil in a medium pot.<br>
            Slowly add the cornmeal while stirring with the wooden cooking stick. <br>
            Reduce the heat to low and keep turning the ugali as it begins to stick together and have a dough-like consistency.<br>
            Keep turning and pressing the ugali until it is stiff and there are no spots of raw cornmeal. 
            It may be a workout, but that’s how you know you’re making ugali! 
            Cover and let it steam for 10 minutes.<br>
            You’ll know it’s ready when it has an aroma of roasted corn.<br>
            Pull out of the fire and turn over the pot onto a plate. The ugali will fall out.<br>
            Use the wooden cooking stick or spatula to shape it into a round ball or disk while still hot.<br>
            Cut into the desired number of pieces while serving.<br>
            <strong>Prepare the kachumbari</strong><br><br>
            Wash the tomatoes.<br>
            Dice the onions and tomatoes.<br>
            Mix them in a bowl and add a pinch of salt.<br>
            Chop the nyama choma into small pieces, or as preferred, and place on a plate. Add a piece of ugali and 2-3 tsp kachumbari. <br>
