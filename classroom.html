        <h2>VIS Room 206 - Description </h2>
        <p>The VIS 208 classroom is located on the second floor of the VIS building on Princetonâ€™s 
            campus. <span class="middle">Sitting in this room, one striking feature is how well-lit it is because of the  
                huge windows on two sides of the room especially given that it is a cloudy/ rainy day today. 
                One of these two sides faces Nassau Street which means that occasionally, the chaotic sounds of 
                a busy street find their way  into the room.</span> On this rainy day, one can clearly hear the intermittent 
            sounds of splashing water on the tarmac as the cars speed by. <span class="end">could also hear the raindrops falling 
                on the air conditioner that protrudes to the outside of the room as I am sitting on the side of the 
                room closest to it.The open window lets in a cool breeze that</span>  makes the room not too cold, but slightly chilly. </p>
